Blockchain E-voting done right Privacy and transparency with public blockchain.

Electronic voting (e-voting) can improve electoral processes by enhancing accessibility, efficiency, and security. However, traditional e-voting systems rely on centralized authorities, making them vulnerable to manipulation, cyberattacks, and lack of transparency. This paper proposes a blockchain-based e-voting system that ensures both privacy and transparency using a public blockchain, enabling secure and verifiable elections while protecting voter anonymity.  

Our approach leverages blockchain’s decentralized and immutable nature to create a tamper-resistant election process where all transactions are publicly auditable. To preserve voter privacy, we integrate cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and homomorphic encryption, allowing voters to verify their votes without revealing identities. Smart contracts automate vote recording, counting, and validation, eliminating human errors and reducing the risk of fraud.  

Unlike permissioned blockchains, a public blockchain removes reliance on a central authority, ensuring resilience against censorship and manipulation. Each vote is recorded as an immutable transaction, allowing voters and third-party auditors to verify election integrity. End-to-end verifiability ensures transparency while maintaining confidentiality, preventing unauthorized access to voter data.  

Key challenges such as voter authentication, vote privacy, and coercion resistance are addressed using decentralized identity verification and cryptographic safeguards. Scalability concerns are mitigated with layer-2 solutions to handle large-scale elections efficiently without compromising security.  

This system achieves a balance between transparency and privacy, fostering trust in digital elections. By leveraging blockchain’s security and cryptographic advancements, we propose a robust framework for verifiable, tamper-proof, and privacy-preserving e-voting. Our findings demonstrate that blockchain-based e-voting, when properly designed, can provide a secure and transparent platform for democratic participation. This research contributes to the future of digital democracy by offering a decentralized, trustworthy solution that enhances electoral integrity while safeguarding voter confidentiality.
